print("\nRoblox in my opinion is a == 'sandbox', due to the the fact that you can literally create any game you want, limited to the 32bit engine that it runs.")
print(roblox == 'sandbox')

print("\nOne of the most well known luxury cars is == 'bmw', you literally can't go around the world without hearing of seeing one.")

print("\nI think an awesome car would be a == 'Toyota', however the main issue with them is the cost, I'm not super sure I can look past the cost as easily as I would wanna say I can.")

print("\nI think one of the most ideal cars would be something like a == 'subaru' since they're one of the best sounding cars that I've personally heard of, and I hear that they're really safe, too.")
