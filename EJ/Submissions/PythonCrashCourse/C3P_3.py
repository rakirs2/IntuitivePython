#3-3 Your Own List - Program used to print multiple statements of things I want it to say(Transport)
Transport = ["car",'motorcycle','bus','train','airplane']
message = f"Although I have many ways to get places that I like to use, my absolute favorite is most likely to be by {Transport[0].title()}."
print(message)
message = f"I will say, however even though {Transport[0]} is one of the favorite methods of transport, for longer distances I would much rather use a {Transport[1]}, because it's much faster, and I also am fairly sure that if I ever got a motorcycle it would be probably a Harley Davidson"
print(message)
message = f"I will say though as much as a {Transport[0]}, motorcycle, and plane would be fine by me I don't get much of a chance to use {Transport[3]}, because there isn't much reason to."
print(message)
