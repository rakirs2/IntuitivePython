# here we import the module
import copy
#Creating the class
class Car:
    pass
# here car1 = the class Car
car1 = Car()
# here we say car1s' wheels =4
car1.wheels = 4
#Here  the variable car 2 =car1
car2 = car1
#here car2s' wheels = three so car1s' wheels = 3 
car2.wheels = 3
# this will print three 
print(car1.wheels)
#here we create a new variable or list with car1 not car1.wheels
car3 = copy.copy(car1)
#so since we did not copy car1.wheels car1.wheels=3 still
car3.wheels = 6
#printing 3
print(car1.wheels)
